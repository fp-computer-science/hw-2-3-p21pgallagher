### Basic Data Types 
---

Answer each of the following questions in a separate Python file named `hw2-3-#.py` where `#` is the number of the question. In your heading, put your name and the date you began working on the file. Be sure to write each program in a way that allows you to swap values to make the program more versatile.


1. Write a Python program that will display the following pattern:
   ```
   PPPPP   Y   Y   TTTTT   H   H   OOOOO   N   N
   P   P    Y Y      T     H   H   O   O   NN  N

   P         Y       T     H   H   OOOOO   N   N
   ```

2. Write a Python program that will display the area and perimeter of a circle that has a radius of `4.6`.

3. Write a Python program that will display the area and perimeter of a rectangle that has a width of `13.9` and a height of `8.2`.

4. The US Census Bureau has a real time population clock which can be found at the following link: https://www.census.gov/popclock. Using this information, and September 23, 2020 as a start date, write a program that will give the expected US population on September 24, 2021.
